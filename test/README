This is just to check that all the headers and libraries are in place
the C DRMAA installation.

gcc -o test_drmaa -ldrmaa test_drmaa.c 
./test_drmaa

The output is:
DRMAA library was started successfully

If compilation fails, check the following environment variables (or use -L and -I).
CPATH
LIBRARY_PATH
LD_LIBRARY_PATH
