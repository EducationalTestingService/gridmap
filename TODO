TODO

pre-0.3:
+ update to new DRMAA wrapper!
+ clearly document "submit and wait" and "submit and collect"
+ remove hard-coded env vars and paths

post-0.3:
+ add apply_to_combination as helper
+ Unify method jobs, reconsider whether it makes sense to have this
+ Need a better way to set job and file names. Preferably human readable and unique.
+ Clear memory after pickling in the constructor, so reduce memory usage
+ validate member flags for KybJob
+ hold interface
