pythongrid - a high level front end to DRMAA-python
===================================================

.. contents::

Introduction
============
The module pythongrid.py provides wrappers that simplify 
submission and collection of jobs, in a more 'pythonic' fashion.
It also uses the same interface for running jobs locally on the
same machine using threads. This may be useful for debugging purposes,
and may also be faster if the cluster is busy and the jobs are small.

Installation
============

Install
-------

Untar the archive, and put pythongrid.py somewhere in $PYTHONPATH

    $ tar xzvf pythongrid-0.1.tar.gz

DRMAA-python is required. To check that everything has installed
properly

    >>> import DRMAA
    >>> import pythongrid


Dependencies
------------

- `DRMAA-python`_ (>=0.2.2)
- `easysvm`_  (>=0.2) [optional]

.. _`DRMAA-python`: http://gridengine.sunsource.net/howto/drmaa_python.html
.. _`easysvm`_ : http://www.easysvm.org


Usage
=====

Three functions wrap the complexity:

- submitJobs takes a list of jobs and sends them to the cluster
- collectJobs takes a list of job ids and collects their results
- processJobs provides a shortcut that does both in series. It also
  provides an option to run locally.

Please look at the examples for usage details.

To use a function within the module itself, one has to import the
module explicitly from within the module. This is to resolve
namespaces in python
